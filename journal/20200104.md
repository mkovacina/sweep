not much time today.

trying to just replace the call to clear_nls()

the swap was pretty easy.  there are more things to fix, but this closes the SGD file issue.

makefiles are fun.  adding string-util.c was causing an odd make error.  so i removed it from the list of sources...got the previous error.  added it to a different spot...everything worked correctly.  put it back to where i initially had it...it worked as expected.  this is the good life.
