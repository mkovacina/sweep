better late than never.

fixing the issue where the windows end of line messes up SWEEP reading files.  
the extra characters as the end result in a file not found.

so i decided that instead of fixing the clear_nls() function which iterated over a collection of strings, i'd write a trim function.

so while i wanted to trim in-place, i didn't want to deal with the copy-left for trimming the left of the string.  thus i decided to pass in a separate buffer.  but now things are getting more complicated than i wanted, plus i'm trying to figure out how i want to add unit testing to all this and TDD my way through.

but riding in the car to mom's house led to the realization that i only need the right-trim right now.  sure, i should have the left trim too, but let's be iterative.

and the simple right trim starts seg faulting...hello gdb.  not obvious.  everything seems correct.  then it hits me.

the problem is that `char* input = "spaceman\n"` can't be modified...segfault.

change it to `char input[] = "spaceman\n"` and progress continues.
